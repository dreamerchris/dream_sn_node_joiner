# multi_sn_node_joiner
WIP sets up multiple users in a debian machine, installs safe and node, then joins the testnet


what it does now:
-creates new user
-add new user to sudoers
-install safe
-install node

to be done:
- it currently asks for the password of the new user so it can install safe node
- the user should not be requested a user password
